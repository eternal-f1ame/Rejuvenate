## Methods
### PDE Inpainting based on Image Characteristics
PDE image inpainting method considers the gray distribution of image as heat distribution and regards the process of image evolution as heat conduction. By establishing and solving the corresponding PDE model to accomplish heat diffusion, image gray will be redistributed . PDE image in painting method interpolates the missing gray values for the initial image through gray diffusion.

### Harmonic Inpainting
Harmonic Inpainting extending the harmonic function from the boundary of the missing domain into the interior to fill in missing parts of an image. The inpainted image is computed as a solution of the Laplace equation or as a minimiser of the Dirichlet energy over the inpainting domain. It constitutes a smooth and linear interpolation process that roughly fills in missing grey values by averaging the given grey values on the boundary of the inpainting domain.

## MAT Architecture

- A convolutional head to extract tokens
- A transformer body with five stages of transformer blocks at varying resolutions that use multi-head contextual attention (MCA) to model long-range interactions
- A convolution-based reconstruction module to upsample the spatial resolution of output tokens
- A Conv-U-Net to refine high-frequency details
- A style manipulation module to deliver diverse predictions by modulating the weights of convolutions.

## Structure

* The folder "visual" consists of code relevant to the visual watermarking attack and dataset generation.
  * Modify the image directory path in the `prepare_dataset.py` as per your requirements.
  * first prepare the dataset by running the `prepare_dataset.py`. Make sure to create the folders `outputs` and `removal_results`.
  * Now run the `remove_watermark.py` file to see the results.

* The folder "util" contains helper facilities to run the encryption algorithms on different inputs and check their output.
* The file `metrics.py` consists of several metrics which we have implemented to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. To add another metric just create a function and add the mapping in the dictionary at the bottom of the file as has been illustrated.
* For more comprehensive analysis and comparison, refer to [report](/documents/report.pdf).
